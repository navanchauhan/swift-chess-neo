# SwiftChessNeo

**WIP: I am actively developing swift-chess-neo while writing iWatchChess for iOS/macOS**

Fork of [Sage by @nvzqz](https://github.com/nvzqz/Sage) along with [@SuperGeroy](https://github.com/SuperGeroy)'s patches. This fork adds SwiftUI views, and other QoL improvements. Due to some technical difficulties, I ended up copying the files in the `Sources` folder and adding them to my project. 

## To-Do

- [ ] SwiftUI Views (In-Progress)
- [ ] UCI Chess Engine Support
- [ ] SVG Resources
- Move Handling
    - [ ] Enhance PGN Parsing
    - [ ] Comprehensive PGN Support
    - [ ] Support for different lines
- [ ] GameplayKit Support


### Possible Misc Enhancements

- Integrated Lichess Client (?)
- Player Database (?)
